# Network Building

*Why a lecture on network building?*

A few reasons:

* My opinion is that the most valuable advice comes from those with direct
experience
* Good networks are powerful tools
* It’s hard to“seek advice,” without advisors
* Networking is supes awkward, but a necessary business skillset

Five sections to this lecture:

1. Professional preparation
2. Types of networks
3. Common opportunities for networking
4. Networking tips
5. Mock networking event!

## 1. Professional Preperation
Make sure your public persona is locked in and your tools ready:

* Make sure your website / resume / portfolio is up to date
* Set privacy settings on social media accounts
* Create ‘professional’ social media accounts
* Materials printed and on-hand
* Have your Rolodex at the ready
	* (who knows what this is?)

## 2. Types of Networks

**Expansive** — The whole enchilada. This is the umbrella network of everyone you
know.

**Nodal** — A set of industry-specific or context-specific contacts

**Operational** — People you connect to through your place of employment

**Strategic** — People who aren’t necessarily tied to an industry (nodal), but can
offer valuable insight, advice, or strategy from a larger perspective

**Personal** — Your friends, family, etc.

## 3. Common Opportunities for Networking
* Cold calls* 
* Networking events 
* Professional events (Conferences, seminars)
* Social events
* Informational interviews

*Cold calls are a terrible idea. Focus on getting an introduction by a third party—i.e. I introduce you to my friend within a company via e-mail.

## 4. Networking Tips
### *In General*

* **INITIATE** — You have to try
* **CULTIVATE** — Focus on relationship building
* **RECIPROCATE** — Pay it forward. Introduce others. Advocate. Build trust
and camaraderie

### *Utilizing Advocates*

A good advocate can be your most powerful tool. Think of this as beyond a traditional reference. An ultra-reference.

* Make sure your advocate is willing
* Make sure your advocate is well informed 
* Only use advocates that know you well
  * Or have at least seen a recent resume!

### *Networking Online*

* Writ wel and fcous on as efw err rs as posable
* Write for the audience and for whomever it could be forwarded to
* Double-check anything googlable
* Remember that nothing digital completely vanishes (thanks to screenshots)
* Check your tone—The less human the method of communication, the harder to read the intended emotion.

### *Networking In-person*

* Remember Inigo Montoya

* Have your elevator pitch ready

  * A primer about yourself (and/or your work) that is practiced and can be expressed in 30 seconds — the average amount of time for an elevator ride with an imporant person. A captive audience!

* Don't dominate the conversation

  * Especially in a group setting!

* Ask questions! 

  * This shows attentiveness and respect

* Remember S.T.A.R. for storytelling
  * Situation - Set the stage
  * Task - What was happening?
  * Action - How did you take action?
  * Result- What was the outcome?
