## 1. Grant Basics

### 1A - Defining grants

For our purposes, we're going to define grants the following way:*

>The transfer of something of value for a specific purpose or particular use. 

It may be easier to define what a grant is by what it is not:

* A grant is not a **loan** — loans come with the expectation of repayment (plus interest)
* A grant is not a **gift** — Gifts don't require reciprocation. Grants require performance of some type. (This is different for awards and fellowships).
* A grant is not a **sale** — Sales are when two parties exchange something of value. Grants are a one-way street: the grantor is giving value to the grantee. What is required in return is **performance.**
* A grant is not an **investment** — When someone invests (purchases equity), they own part of your business. 

### 1B — Why seek grants?

A grant is when something of value (usually money) is transferred to another party (you) for a specific purpose or particular use (what you proposed).

Grants are a form of fundraising that provide you resources with the least financial risk and the least long-term liability. 

- Grants are limited. 
- Grants are temporary. 
- Grants are locked into being used for a *specific* purpose. 


## 2. Funding Sources

### 2A — Where do grants come from?

Generally, grants come from three common sources:

**1. Foundations** — A non-profit, charitable organization that award grants to support specific activities that fullfills their mission.

* Examples:
  * [The Andy Warhol Foundation](https://warholfoundation.org/)
  * [The Kresge Foundation](https://kresge.org/programs/arts-culture)
  * [The Knight Foundation](https://knightfoundation.org/programs/arts)
  * [The Guggenheim Foundation](https://www.gf.org/about/fellowship/)

**2. Corporations** — A corporation may dedicate a portion of its profits via a subsidiary non-profit to support specific activities.

* Examples: 
  * [The Coca-Cola Foundation](https://www.coca-colacompany.com/our-company/the-coca-cola-foundation)
  * [The PNC Foundation](https://www.pnc.com/en/about-pnc/corporate-responsibility/philanthropy/pnc-foundation.html)
  * [Google Grants](https://www.google.com/grants/)
  * [Mozilla Foundation](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/)

**3. Government** — Tax dollars are allocated by legislatures for specific purposes, which are awarded as grants by government agencies.

* Examples: 
  * [The National Endowment for the Arts](https://www.arts.gov/)
  * [The National Endowment for the Humanities](https://www.neh.gov/)
  * [Pennsylvania Council on the Arts](https://www.arts.pa.gov/Pages/default.aspx)
  * [Allegheny Regional Asset District ](https://radworkshere.org/)

### 2B — Where does the money come from?

Grant funds are generated in a number of ways. Understanding the difference between the sources of funding can help in determining the scale and scope of a request.  

**1. Foundations**

* From **Endowments** — A principal, invested amount of money that generates interest
  every year. That interest is the amount of money that the foundation can use for grants.
  (A $1m principal produces approx. $50k for grants)
* From **Expendable Gifts** — Unlike an endowment, this principal is spent until the money
  disappears.
* From **Donors** — Some foundations have fundraising campaigns to generate the money
  they use for grants.

**2. Corporations**

* From business funds, usually profits

**3. Government**

* From your tax dollars

### 2C — Why is it important to know the source of the funds?

- [National Endowment for the Arts; Controversy [Wikipedia]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Endowment_for_the_Arts#Controversy)
- [The Koch brothers open their wallets for the arts. But should arts groups take Koch money? [PRI]](https://www.pri.org/stories/2017-07-16/koch-brothers-open-their-wallets-arts-should-arts-groups-take-koch-money)

## 3. Types of Grants

Here are three of the *most common* types of grants: 

* Project/Program Grants — Funds a specific project or supports a distinct program
  * Example: [Creative Capital](https://creative-capital.org/)
* General Operating Support — Funds overhead costs like salaries, rent, etc.
  * Example: [The Heinz Endowments](http://www.heinz.org/)
* Artist Grants or Fellowships — Grants designed specifically to support an
  individual’s practice or mission.
  * Such as the [MacArthur Foundation Fellows Program](https://www.macfound.org/programs/fellows/)
  * Or a local program like the [Greater Pittsburgh Arts Council's Artist Opportunity Grants
    
    ](https://www.pittsburghartscouncil.org/aog)

## 4. Receiving Grant Funds

### 4A — What business structure do I need to get a grant?

* Grants to 501(c)3 not-for-profit organizations are by far the most common. 
* Grants that go to for-profits are more common with government grants.
* Grants to individuals are hard to find, but not uncommon. They usually take the form of an award or a fellowship rather than a project grant. 

### 4B — Do I need to form a non-profit to get grants?

Not neccessarily. There are two common options available to artists:

1. **Partner with a non-profit** —  A common workaround is to partner with an organizations that *can* apply to the grants that you cannot. They take on the burden and pay directly as a contractor. This option obviously requires a great deal of trust. 
   * Example: [Creative Time](http://creativetime.org/projects/karawalker/)

2. **Fiscal Sponsorship** — Sometimes called a fiscal conduit, is when a non-profit
   org enables you to use their non-profit status, for a fee, to accept donations
   and apply for grants.
   * Example: [Fractured Atlas](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/)

### 4C — How will grant funds affect my taxes?

There are different tax considerations for grants based on your business structure:

* **Non-profits** — Grants are considered non-taxable income
* **For-profit** — Corporate and income taxes may apply, but taxable deductions are possible depending on how the funds are spent. 
* **Individual**— The entire grant award may be considered personal income and taxes may apply, but taxable deductions are possible depending on how the funds are spent. 
* **For-profits and individuals via fiscal sponsor** — 
  * There should be no taxes. You essentially are 'loaned' a non-profit's ability to be tax-free. 
  * If you are paid (such as a contractor fee), you will have to pay income tax on that amount. 


## 5. The Grant Proposal Process

### 5A — The Basic Process

*Each grant maker is slightly different, but here is the general, over-simplified process:*

1. Come up with a fundable idea
2. Seek out funding opportunities
3. If possible, meet with a program officer / attend a workshop by the funder / take part in a funder's webinar
4. Apply
   1. Send a **LOI** — Letter of Inquiry  
      *and/or*
   2. Respond to an **RFP** — A Request for Proposals
5. If awarded, carry out the activity
6. Send in a Grant Report documenting project outcomes

### 5B — Stewardship

Be a good steward of funding!

* ***Always*** act ethically when spending grant funds
* Keep an open dialogue with your program officer
* Invite funders to see the work!
* Credit funders appropriately on programs and signage. Many funders have these requirements in the grant award agreements. 
* Follow-up. After completeing a grant and turning in the report, connect with teh pgoram officer to check-in and keep the relationship going. 


## 6. Writing a good proposal

The best advice I can give for preparing a successful proposal is to be **organized**, **clear**, and **to seek feedback**. 

Grant proposals are judged on a number of factors: clear writing, feasibility of the idea, sensibility of the budget, etc. 

The best way to learn is to apply. 

*...but we're going to cover some tips and best practices.* 


*A quick definition:*

>Proposals–colloquially called grants–are technical documents that appeal for resources such as money, space, and equipment. [[source]](https://writingcommons.org/open-text/genres/professional-business-and-technical-writing/1245-proposal-writing-basics
>)

### 6A — General Grant-writing Tips

*What makes a good grant?*

* A strong argument for why funding is neccessary
* Understanding a funder's priorities and goals
* Having clearly articulated goals and outcomes
* Writing for the correct audience
* Consistency in language, tone and concept.
* Following the RFP requirements. 
* Having a professional budget that matches the proposal narrative

### 6B — Pre-Proposal Steps

1. **Analyze resources** - What does your creative practice have on hand? What do you need?
2. **Identify key partners** — Are you working with someone else? Would they bolster your application? 
3. **Set project/program goals** — What are you trying to accomplish with this funding? How will it affect your practice and career?
4. **Set a timeline** — How much time do you have to find funding? How long will the project last?
5. **Identify a funder** — This could also be the first step, often an RFP can inspire a project or program. The important step here is to *match* your project to an appropriate fund. 

### 6C — Funding Research

1. **Identify the funding stream or likely funder**
   * Example: [The Foundation Center](https://foundationcenter.org/) and [Grantspace](https://grantspace.org/resources/knowledge-base/funding-for-individual-artists/)
   * [NYFA Source](http://source.nyfa.org/content/search/search.aspx?SA=1)
   * [Americans for the Arts](https://www.americansforthearts.org/by-topic/funding-resources)

2. **Look at that funder's cycles and RFPs**
   * Example: [Creative Capital](https://creative-capital.org/)
3. **Check terms and conditions**
   * Example: [The NEA Art Works program](https://www.arts.gov/grants-organizations/art-works/grant-program-description)
4. **Look at past grants awarded**
   * Example: [A.W. Mellon](https://mellon.org/grants/grants-database/)
5. **Identify connections and program officers** 
   * [The Knight Foundation](https://knightfoundation.org/)

### 6D — Alignment and Translation

*Ask yourself the following questions as you prepare your proposal:*

1. Do you meet all the RFP requirements?

2. Do you match the organization's goals?
3. Can you 'translate' your project into the language and tone of the funder?
   * Don't automatically change your project, translate your project.
4. What could a long-term relationship with this funder look like?

### 6E — General Writing Tips

1. Start with your **case for funding**

  * Can you clearly and concisely describe the project/program?
  * You should be able to verbally describe your proposal is less than 30 seconds. 

2. Create a proposal checklist

3. Write for your audience

4. Write multiple drafts

5. Have peers review and give feedback

6. Check for consistency of language and concepts

7. Run sepllchek

8. Triple check your proposal checklist before submission

9. Create a language bank for the next proposal

### 6F — Budgets

*Format*

1. Proposal budgets will typically just focus on a project's projected revenue and expenses.

2. Check to see if your funder has a premade budget template
   * Example: [Knight Foundation Budget Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U0gS4frUWTbaDCWmn7b8LNywPB7uVkLjRnXqmUQJKEk/edit?usp=sharing)
3. Looking closely at the RFP for budget conditions
   * Example: [NEA Art Works](https://www.arts.gov/sites/default/files/FY21-gap-visual-arts.pdf) 
4. Above all, make sure your budget matches your proposal! 

*General tips for budgets*

1. Build in items that you may need later (such as equipment)
2. Find ways to pay people 
3. Don't get greedy
4. Don't be a cheapskate either
5. Consider any in-kind support
6.  Put in an artist's fee*

**This does not apply to getting a grant inside an organization you work within.* 

### 6G — Some Final Advice

1. **Most funders don't like taking risks.** Start with smaller grants and build that relationship. Once a funder sees you as a good bet, then go big and make the major ask. 
2. **Relationships with program officers pays off.** Their job is to give people money, but remember that they are—in best-case scenarios—your collaborator, not your bank account. 
3. **Don't get discourages if you fail! Ask for feedback.** There are many reasons why you did not get funded—it's not automatically because your idea was bad. You'll only find out by following up for feedback. 
4. **Apply!** You'll never know if you don't try. 



## 7. Workshop: Making a Case for Funding 

We're going to practice making a clear, articulate case for support. 

1. Spend five minutes and prepare a case for fund your practice
   - What will the money be spent on?
   - Why is this important?
   - Why should I care?
2. Challenges
   - Change your case to match the following funders:
     - An foundation supporting the arts
     - A museum residency
     - A government agency
     - A public art comission
   - Take you case for funding and write it down in...
     - 200 words or less. 
     - 100 words or less. 
     - 250 characters. 
     - 100 characters. 
     - 5 words. 
     - 1 word. 
   - Make your case for funding...
     - Over the phone
     - In front of a group
     - To someone completely outside of your field
3. Budgeting exercise
   - Take a few minutes to make a budget
     - Now cut the total requested amount in half. 
     - Now cut that new amount in half. 
     - Now take the orignal budget request and double it.
