## Grant Basics*For our purposes, we're going to define grants the following way:*
>The transfer of something of value for a specific purpose or particular use. 

### Grants vs. Gifts*How are grants different from regular gifts?*

* Gifts are **non-reciprocal** * Grants **require performance*** If you receive a grant for an activity, you must carry out that activity or thefunder may ask for the money back.

### Funding Sources
*Where do grants come from?*  
Generally, grants come from three common sources:* **Foundations** — A non-profit, charitable organization that award grants tosupport specific activities.	* Examples:
		* [The Andy Warhol Foundation](https://warholfoundation.org/)
		* [The Kresge Foundation](https://kresge.org/programs/arts-culture)
		* [The Knight Foundation](https://knightfoundation.org/programs/arts)
		* [The Guggenheim Foundation](https://www.gf.org/about/fellowship/)* **Corporations** — A corporation may dedicate a portion of funds via asubsidiary non-profit to support specific activities.	* Examples: 
		* [The Coca-Cola Foundation](https://www.coca-colacompany.com/our-company/the-coca-cola-foundation)
		* [The PNC Foundation](https://www.pnc.com/en/about-pnc/corporate-responsibility/philanthropy/pnc-foundation.html)
		* [Google Grants](https://www.google.com/grants/)
		* [Mozilla Foundation](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/)* **Government** — Tax dollars set aside for specific purposes, awarded as grants.	* Examples: 
		* [The National Endowment for the Arts](https://www.arts.gov/)
		* [The National Endowment for the Humanities](https://www.neh.gov/)
		* [Pennsylvania Council on the Arts](https://www.arts.pa.gov/Pages/default.aspx)
		* [Allegheny Regional Asset District ](https://radworkshere.org/)

*Where does the money come from?*  Grant funds are generated in a number of ways. Understanding the difference between the sources of funding can help in determining the scale and scope of a request.  * **Foundations**	* From **Endowments** — A principal, invested amount of money that generates interestevery year. That interest is the amount of money that the foundation can use for grants.(A $1m principal produces approx. $50k for grants)	* From **Expendable Gifts** — Unlike an endowment, this principal is spent until the moneydisappears.	* From **Donors** — Some foundations have fundraising campaigns to generate the moneythey use for grants.* **Corporations**	* From business funds, usually profits* **Government**	* From your tax dollars

### Types of Grants
Here are three of the most common types of grants: * Project/Program Grants — Funds a specific project or supports a distinct program	* Example: [Creative Capital](https://creative-capital.org/)* General Operating Support — Funds overhead costs like salaries, rent, etc.	* Example: [The Heinz Endowments](http://www.heinz.org/)* Artist Grants or Fellowships — Grants designed specifically to support anindividual’s practice or mission.	* Such as the [MacArthur Foundation Fellows Program](https://www.macfound.org/programs/fellows/)

### Receiving Grant Funds

*What business structure do I need to get a grant?*

* Technically, Any of the business structures we’ve discussed can get grants.	* Grants to non-profits are by far the most common. 
		* *Why do you think this is the most common?*	* Grants to for-profits are more common with government grants.	* Grants to individuals are hard to find, but not uncommon.*How will grant funds affect your taxes?*There are different tax considerations for grants based on your business structure:* **Non-profits** — Grants are considered non-taxable income* **For-profit** — Taxes may apply, but taxable deductions are possible depending on how the funds are spent. * **Individual**— Taxes may apply, but taxable deductions are possible depending on how the funds are spent. * **For-profits and individuals via fiscal sponsor** — No taxes. You essentially are 'loaned' a non-profit's ability to be tax-free. 

*Fiscal Sponsorship?*  
Individuals, partnerships and corporations can receive tax-deductible gifts ifthey have **fiscal sponsorship**.* **Fiscal Sponsorship** — Sometimes called a fiscal conduit, is when a non-profitorg enables you to use their non-profit status, for a fee, to accept donationsand apply for grants.	* Example: [Fractured Atlas](https://www.fracturedatlas.org/)

## The Grant Proposal Process
*Each grant maker is slightly different, but here is the general process:*

1. Come up with a fundable idea1. Seek out funding opportunities1. If possible, meet with a program officer1. Apply1. Send a LOI — Letter of Inquiry  *and/or*1. Respond to an RFP — A Request for Proposals1. If awarded, carry out the activity1. Send in a Grant Report documenting project outcomes

##### Grant-writing tips
*We'll go over this more in D.6, but here are some overall tips:*  What makes a good grant?* A strong argument for funding necessity* Understanding a funder's priorities and goals* Having clearly articulated goals and outcomes* Writing for the right audience* Consistency in language, tone and concept.* Following the RFP requirements. * Having a professional budget that matches the proposal narrative

##### Stewardship
Be a good steward of funding!* ***Always*** act ethically when spending grant funds* Keep an open dialogue with your program officer* Invite funders to see the work!* Credit funders appropriately on programs and signage. Many funders have these requirements in the grant award agreements. 
* Follow-up. After completeing a grant and turning in the report, connect with teh pgoram officer to check-in and keep the relationship going. 

### Some general tips

1. **Most funders don't like taking risks.** Start with smaller grants and build that relationship. Once a funder sees you as a good bet, then go big and make the major ask. 

2. **Relationships with program officers pays off.** Their job is to give people money, but remember that they are—in best-case scenarios—your collaborator, not your bank account. 

3. **Don't get discourages if you fail! Ask for feedback.** There are many reasons why you did not get funded—it's not automatically because your idea was bad. You'll only find out by following up for feedback. 

4. **Apply!** You'll never know if you don't try. 


## Writing a good proposal
The best advice I can give for preparing a successful proposal is to be organized, clear, and to seek feedback. Grant proposals are judged on a number of factors: clear writing, feasibility of the idea, sensibility of the budget, etc. 

The best way to learn is to apply. 

*...but we're going to cover some tips and best practices.* 


*A quick definition:*
>Proposals–colloquially called grants–are technical documents that appeal for resources such as money, space, and equipment. [[source]](https://writingcommons.org/open-text/genres/professional-business-and-technical-writing/1245-proposal-writing-basics
)


### Pre-Proposal Steps
1. **Analyze resources** - What does your creative practice have on hand? What do you need?
2. **Set project/program goals** — What are you trying to accomplish with this funding? How will it affect your practice and career?
3. **Set a timeline** — How much time do you have to find funding? How long will the project last?
4. **Identify a funder** — This could also be the first step, often an RFP can inspire a project or program. The important step here is to *match* your project to an appropriate fund. 

### Funding Research
1. **Identify the funding stream or likely funder**
	* Example: [The Foundation Center](https://foundationcenter.org/) 

2. **Look at that funder's cycles and RFPs**
	* Example: [Creative Capital](https://creative-capital.org/)
3. **Check terms and conditions**
	* Example: [The NEA Art Works program](https://www.arts.gov/grants-organizations/art-works/grant-program-description)
4. **Look at past grants awarded**
	* Example: [A.W. Mellon](https://mellon.org/grants/grants-database/)
5. **Identify connections and program officers** 
	* [The Knight Foundation](https://knightfoundation.org/)

### Aligning and Translating
Ask yourself the following questions as you prepare your proposal:

1. Do you meet all the RFP requirements?

2. Do you match the organization's goals?
3. Can you 'translate' your project into the language and tone of the funder?
	* Don't automatically change your project, translate your project.
4. What could a long-term relationship with this funder look like?

### General Writing Tips
1. Start with your **case for funding**
  * Can you clearly and concisely describe the project/program?
  * You should be able to verbally describe your proposal is less than 30 seconds. 
2. Create a proposal checklist

3. Write for your audience

4. Write multiple drafts
5. Have peers review and give feedback
6. Check for consistency of language and concepts
7. Run sepllchek
8. Triple check your proposal checklist before submission

9. Create a language bank for the next proposal

### Budgets
*Format*

1. Proposal budgets will typically look like an income statements—they focus on expenses and income.
3. Check to see if your funder has a premade budget template
	* Example: Knight Foundation Budget Template
4. Looking closely at the RFP for budget conditions
	* Example: NEA Art Works 
5. Above all, make sure your budget matches your proposal. 

*General tips*
