60-350 Business Fundamentals for Creative Practices

### What is this workshop?
This workshop is about cooking. 

No, really! It is!

My theory is that business is like cooking. I've spent a lot of time over the past year teaching myself to cook. One of my favorite books on the subject is [Salt Fat Acid Heat](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Salt-Fat-Acid-Heat/Samin-Nosrat/9781476753836) by Samin Nosrat. 

The basic premise is that mastering four basic factors will make food taste delicious. But these are just *elements* of good cooking. There is a world of amazing food that depends heavily on our culture, background, personal taste and preference—and our appetites.   

Business is very much the same way. We're going to discuss how business works and go through many of the best practices—but how you best apply these factors to your practice depends on your background, your tastes, your needs.  

So by the end of this workshop, you'll have a financial recipe for your practice. But I hope you take that recipe and alter it, change it, and whip up something that fits with your needs. 


### Workshop Agenda
1. Practice, Career, & Hustle
2. Future vision
3. Cost of Living
4. Sources of income
4. The two types of work
5. Taxes!
6. Applying the formula
8. The two pies



## 1. Practice, Career & Hustle
In running your creative practice, I think you're time is basically split into three groups. Think of these groups of where you expend. 

You expend your effort, your time and your money. 

![](https://github.com/Orthelious/workshops/blob/master/Images/WorkTime.gif?raw=true)

* **Practice** — Your creative practice. Your artistic identity. 
* **Career** — Your professional presentation to the world. 
* **Hustle** — How you make money.

These things can be related. Your hustle could also be your career. Your practice could be the moneymaker. Your career can incorporte both your hustle and your practice. 

But for the purpose of this workshop, I want you to seperate them in you mind becaiuse they are *very* different types of activites. 

>Who can give some examples from their life?

## 2. Future Vision
I want you to take a few minutes to envision yourself one year from your graduation day. 

* *What do you do?*

* *Where do you live?*

* *How much do your work?*

* *What is worrying for you?*

* *What is exciting for you?*

Spend a few minutes and thing about...

## 3. Cost of Living
![](https://media.giphy.com/media/jv0TnQE80z8wU/giphy.gif)

Now that we have our future selves in mind, let's figure out what that life *costs.*

Take a piece of paper and create a quick budget for the year. Make sure to at least include these items: 

1. Rent or mortgage
2. Studio rental/storage
3. Art materials, supplies
2. Utilities
3. Phone Bill
4. Internet
5. Groceries
6. Transportation
7. Eating out / Entertainment
8. Health Insurance
9. Student Loan Payments
10. Clothing
11. Savings
12. Oh @#$! Money

Total it all up and you have your **annual cost of living.** Another way to put it is that this is the **net income** you will need to live this future lifestyle. 

## 4. Sources of Income
Now that we know where your money is going, we think about where the money is coming from. Try to list out all of the ways you can *make* money. 

Here are some to get started:

* Salary from a full-time job
* Fee from a consulting service
* Contract work installing a show
* A sale of a piece of artwork
* Licensing your music online
* Getting a grant from a foundation

## 5. The Two Types of Work
When you operate in business, there are two primary groups that workers fall into:

1. **Employees** — An employee is a person employed for wages or salary, who provides ongoing services for an employer. 

2. **Freelance** — Also called an independent contractor, a freelancer is someone that works for themselves. They do work for different companies, for different amounts of time. 

*These distinctions are very important to understand.* If you're doing business for yourself, you're a freelancer. If you do work for someone else, whether you're a freelancer or employee needs to be discussed with the person paying you for the work. 

For a more in-depth answer, the IRS offers a an explanation: [https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/understanding-employee-vs-contractor-designation
](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/understanding-employee-vs-contractor-designation)
>Who can give some examples from their life?

## 6. Taxes!
We all have to pay them. Taxes differ widely whether you're an employee or an independant contractor. What I've included for this workshop is a *very approximate average that is on the high end to illustrate a point.* 

Want to know what the actual percentage is? Go here: https://www.taxformcalculator.com/tax.html

1. Employees  

		Income Tax (Federal and State) = Avg 15%  
		SS/Medicare = Avg 8%
		
		Total Taxes = 23%

2. Freelancers

		Income Tax (Federal and State) = Avg 15%
		SS/Medicare* = Avg 16%
		
		Total Taxes = Avg 31%
		
		*This is higher because as a self-employed person, you have to pay for yourself plus what an employer would normally have to pay for an employee (8%+8%).

**CAVEAT:** There are ways to reduce the amount of taxes you must pay. This is primarily done through business deductions. You can read a more in-depth explanation here: [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tax-deduction.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tax-deduction.asp)

For the purposes of this workshop, we're just going to assume you're paying the full tax amount.

## 7. Applying the Formula

Let's figure out how much we need to make to live our future lives!!

1. Decide on your future status. Let's keep it to either employee or freelancer to keep it simple. 

1. Add up your projected expenses and find your cost of living (COL). 

1. Divide your COL by your tax rate to find the *gross amount of money you need to make.*
			
			COL / (1 - TAX RATE) = Gross Income
*For example:*
			
			Employee 
			$40,000 / (1 - .23) = $51,948
			
			Freelancer
			$40,000 / (1 - .31) = $57,971

Don't panic! There are ways to pay less taxes through deductions, etc. But this exercise is here to give you a general idea of how much you'll need to make.

### Calculating a base rate
You can use this exercise to calculate the minimum hourly rate you need to charge to get by. Do this by dividing your Gross Income by 2,000 hours (i.e. 40 hours a week, 50 weeks a year)

**1. Base Hourly Rate**

  			Employee 
			$40,000 / (1 - .23) = $51,948
			51,948 / 2,000 hours = $26 per hour
			
			Freelancer
			$40,000 / (1 - .31) = $57,971
			$57,971 / 2,000 = $29/hour

			
**2. Base Day Rate**  
Assuming 8 hours in a workday, we can calculate a minimum base rate by dividing 2,000 hours by 8, giving us 250 days.

			Employee 
			$40,000 / (1 - .23) = $51,948
			51,948 / 250 days = $208 per day
			
			Freelancer
			$40,000 / (1 - .31) = $57,971
			$57,971 / 250 days = $232 per day

**3. Mix and match**  
Let's go back to number 4 "Sources of Income" and start throwing some numbers together. We can do the math in reverse to figure out if we're making *enough money to live our future life style.*

Let's assume you work 32 hours a week at a hustle job, which is paying you a wage of $18/hour. You've managed to keep a side business going as a freelancer, which you hope to average at least 5 hours a week at $15 per hour. In addition your online sales on your website have brought in $4,000 to your practice. 

			TOTAL GROSS INCOME = 36,550

			// Hustle Job
			32 hours x 50 weeks = 1,600 hours
			1,600 hours x $18 per hour = 28,800
			28,800 - (28,800 x 23% Tax Rate) = 22,176
			
			// Side Freelance Gig
			5 hours x 50 weeks = 250 hours
			250 hours x $15 per hour = 3,750
			3,750 - (3,750 x 31% tax rate) = 2,588
			
			// Online Sales (Income will count the same as freelance work)
			4,000 - (4,000 x 31% tax rate) = 2,760
			
			TOTAL NET INCOME = $27,524


## 8. The Two Pies

The final point of this workshop is to develop two pies (see, I told you it was about baking!). 

* One pie for *how you spend your efforts and resources.*
![](https://github.com/Orthelious/workshops/blob/master/Images/WorkTime.gif?raw=true)

* The other pie for *where you income is coming from*. 
![](https://github.com/Orthelious/workshops/blob/master/Images/HowYouMakeMoney.gif?raw=true)

Where you make your money and where you spend your resources are *two different things.* 

Your practice can be successful and make no money. Your hustle could be low-stress, low-effort but bring in the majority of your cash. You could spend most of your resources on advancing your career. 

The point here is to dispel the myth that *your practice = how you making a living.*

We're creative people and our lives are complicated. Apply business strategies to match, adjust the recipes to fit your needs and give it a shot.
